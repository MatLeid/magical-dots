Magical Dots
==================

Magical Dots is an easy to learn puzzling game. Your goal is to align all dots in a way that each 3 of them share a isosceles line.

There are two play modes:

Normal: easy to start with
Hardcore: adds a bit of pepper to the game because dots can move randomly

You can can play it online via:
